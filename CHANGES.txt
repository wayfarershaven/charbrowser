                  wrap automatically when you resize

                  and applied it to the GetItem function

                 Removed error reporting for self registration

               new css/html revamp

                 caching of the image to speed it up
               added new guild page with class and level composition
               added new server page with class and level composition
               updated the ac/hp/mana/atk/endurance calculations
               added a tab to show those calculations

               added some new window graphics--corner scrolls
               moved calculatestats to the profile
               moved the side menu into its own modular template file
               added an update notice to settings.php that'll check
                 github for updates and notify you of changes
               added tabs to the sigbuilder and skills page
               added mitigation ac to the inventory window
               removed autocorrect from all the search fields
               made search fields submit on pressing enter
               version stamps css and js files so users dont
                 cache and old version
               made cb_message_die output an error image for image
                 scripts
               normalized a lot of the html to make it more SEO
                and screen reader friendly
               
              
v2.8.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
shared bank and shared bank coin

Mar 8, 2020 - added the display elements for the shared bank slots
                and the shared bank plat. There are new config file
                elements to support this. You can compare your
                existing config.php to the config.template to see
                but basically you need to add permissions for
                'sharedbank' and 'coinsharedbank'. If you don't
                add them they will default to ON since the
                permissions are exclusive. 
              (maudigan)
              
v2.8.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Inherit admin permissions when wrapped in site header/footer

Mar 8, 2020 - Added the ability to inherit site admin permissions 
              when you wrap charbrowser in your header/footer
              (maudigan)
              
v2.8
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Added soft delete, mouse cursor style, item popups, aa fix, stat calc
error and some other minor tweaks.

Mar 7, 2020 - implemented character soft delets. If a character
                 has their deleted_at set in the character_data table
                 they wont show up in magelo now. You can override
                 that and force them to display by setting 
                 $showsoftdelete = 1;. If you do so they will be 
                 marked "DELETED" when viewed/searched
              Made cursors show up as a pointer when over buttons
                 or interactive links
              If you click item icons or links, it will display a 
                 dragable popup with the items stats now.
              Bags are opened by clicking an arrow in the top left
                 corner of the bag icon now.
              Class AAs were showing the wrong classes abilities
                 that's been fixed
              replaced the deprecated ereg_replace
              fixed char stats to not include augments on inventory
                 and bank items
              (maudigan)
              
v2.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Added corruption, alt item stats display and maintenance

Sep 7, 2019 - Added corruption resist
              Added extra space for large character stats
              Added an alternative item stat display option, set 
                 $itemstatsdisplay to 1 to get a more readable list 
                 view on item stats
              Fixed some typos
              Added commas to numbers on char stats (Kinglykrab)
              

v2.6.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------
added uleats inventory changes

November 10,2018 - Reordered general slots from top to bottom
                   into left to right (Maudigan)
                   Fixed type on bagbuttonrow where 'px' was missing


v2.6.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------
added uleats inventory changes

November 10,2018 - Added uleats inventory changes (Maudigan): 
                      Ammo moved 21 to 22
                      Power source moved 9999 to 21 
                      Cursor moves 30 to 33
                      Bags moved 22-29 to 23-32 (+1 and two new slots)
                      Cursor bag contents moved 331-340 to 351-360
                      New bags contents are in 331-340 and 341-350

v2.6.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------
made the api so it can be turned off

Sep 23, 2018 - set $api_enabled = false in the config to disable
               the api.
               (Maudigan)

v2.6.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Added missing skills and worked on the wrapper functionality

Sep 23, 2018 - Added 2h piercing, tripple attack and remove traps.
               (Maudigan)
               Added a #charbrowser wrapper around all the content
               to prevent stylesheet naming collisions when you
               wrap the page in your forum header/footer
               (Maudigan)

v2.6.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed charmover

Sep 6, 2018 - Removed an extra comma from the update statement.
              (Maudigan)

v2.6.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed the bazaar, database performance, forum wrapping, and
database wrapper.

Jan 7, 2017 - Fixed a typo in the bazaar script that was preventing
              any results from showing up.
              (Maudigan)
              Fixed a reference to the template class in db.php that
              was preventing the database performane stats from
              dumping out.
              (Maudigan)
              Updated db.php wrappers for PHP7
              (Athrogate)
              Updated db wrapper to be an object so it wouldn't
              interfere with header/footer db object

v2.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified some of the code to allow you to embed charbrowser into
a forum header/footer.

Oct 21, 2017 - Between your forum headers include charbrowser
               index.php. Prior to the include turn the simple 
               headers on with:
               $charbrowser_simple_header = true;
               Tell charbrowser that it's being wrapped with:
               $charbrowser_wrapped = true;
               Lastly, you need to set the root path of charbrowser
               so it can correctly find the other images/stylesheets
               to include when the page renders:
               $charbrowser_root_url = "http://eg.com/charbrowser/";
               Those steps are only necessary if you want to wrap
               Charbrowser in your forums.
               The other changes are pretty widespread. A lot of 
               objects have been renamed to reduce the chance that it
               conflicts with your forum objects. Do a version
               compare to see what all changed.
               (Maudigan)

v2.52
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Added omens of war flags, moved $version out of the config.

May 17, 2017 - Added the OOW flags to language.php and flags.php
               (Maudigan)
               Some servers were keeping their old config file,
               which has the version stamp in it. This made it hard
               to identify what build a server was using. That value
               was moved to a stand alone version.php. The order the
               files are included means the variable in version.php
               should overwrite the old one in your config, however
               you should probably pull the new config.template or
               remove the $version variable from config.php.
               (Maudigan)

v2.51
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This release makes the item/spell links more customizable

October 3, 2016 - Added new customizable link templates to the confi
                  file. This is for servers that don't use the PEQ DB
                  so they don't want to link to mqemu's database.
                  (Maudigan)


v2.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This release fixes the aa and corpse pages, but it is mostly to clean
up the code and add features for developers who may want to alter or
extend the code.

September 30, 2014 - Added some new methods to the Template class that
                     let developers access the magelo data in a JSON
                     or XML format. The template values were never
                     meant to be output this way so it's not the
                     cleanest data. To see it, add a variable named
                     "api" to your GET, i.e.
                     corpse.php?char=Maudigan&api (Maudigan)
October 4, 2014 -    Fixed a call to the nonexistant mymessage_die 
                     in item.php. (Maudigan)
                     Moved DB connection stuff out of the config
                     file (Maudigan)
May 22, 2016 -       Cleaned up the way queries are templated.
                     Added wrappers on all the mysql functions which
                     is mostly so future modifications can be done quicker
                     when something changes. it also lets us gather
                     database performance stats (when enabled) without
                     having to run queries twice. It should also let
                     people swap to non mysql databases and only have to 
                     edit db.php instead of a whole mess of
                     different modules. (Maudigan)
                     The database performance code was rewritten to use
                     the normal templating system instead of writing its
                     own HTML. (Maudigan)
                     General code cleanup, replaced tabs with spaces (they're
                     better, so eat-it). Added some extra comments, removed 
                     some old ones. I didn't mark all of it so if youre 
                     curious you'll have to do a compare. (Maudigan)
May 24, 2016 -       Functionized the code that converts directories into
                     the list of options for the signature builder.
                     Made a default return value for profile.php->GetValue()
                     and set the value to 0 to fix the display of skills.php
May 30, 2016 -       Updated aa.php to implement the new aa storage method.
                     Updated corpse.php with the blob changes that I missed
                     on the last update.


v2.41
----------------------------------------------------------------------
September 28, 2014 - added a database stats gathering tool. Uncomment
                     the setting at the bottom of config.php and it will
                     cause every query, its runtime and an explanation
                     to be dumped at the bottom of each page. WARNING:
                     the dumped data is publicly viewable. (Maudigan)
                     Altered the profile class to have a constructor
                     that recieves the charname and populates the
                     basic character data. This permitted the removal
                     of an extra query on nearly every screen. (Maudigan)
September 29, 2014 - completed the character blob modifications.
                     this involved rewriting most of the profile.php
                     script and putting a bandaid on aa.php (Maudigan)
                     Added the missing AA tabs. (Maudigan)

v2.4 (beta)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
September 26, 2014 - Akkadius removed the character blob from the
                     database and triggered this update. All changes
                     are to accomodate the new storage method.
                     Rewrote profile.php, this involved removing old
                     comments; see old versions to view them.
                     Changed character_ table referenes to character_data
                     in multiple files.
                     Rewrote the code that grabbed a characters guild
                     name and rank as the the blob doesn't exist and the
                     new method doesnt track a character guild id. I used
                     this as an opportunity to swap from a WHERE join to
                     a standard JOIN. (Maudigan)


v2.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
February 24, 2014 - Changed item icons to use PNG instead of GIF (Maudigan/Warmonger)
                    Added backstab damage to item display (Kinglykrab)
                    Corrected spelling errors (Kinglykrab)
                    Fixed syntax error in css (Kinglykrab)
February 25, 2014 - Added Heroic stats and aug types (Kinglykrab)
                    Added infinite charge text to items (Kinglykrab)
                    Added Drakkin/Powersource to bazaar (Kinglykrab)



v2.25 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
February 9, 2014 - Fixed charm item type getting set wrong (Maudigan)
February 12, 2014 - Added/Updated item icons 2588-4819. (Maudigan)
